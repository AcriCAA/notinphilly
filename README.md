# notinphilly

**Concept**: In return for a 6 month commitment to go out once a week to pick up the litter on a block, we supply citizens of Philadelphia with a trash grabber.

To run the app locally:
1. Git clone the solution
2. Install nodejs, npm, bower, mongodb
3. Run `npm install` in the folder
4. Run `bower install`
5. Run `node server --seed-db` to start the server and seed the database. You can access the server http://localhost:8080.
6. In the future, just type `node server`, you only need to seed the database once.
