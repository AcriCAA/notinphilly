<div class="agreement-terms">
    <p>I, the undersigned volunteer (or parent/legal guardian if volunteer is under age 18), execute this Release and Waiver of Liability (the “Release”) in favor of Pennsylvania Resources Council, Inc. (“PRC”), and all PRC affiliated organizations, and all sponsors, "partner organizations" or other organizations participating in the project known as Not in Philly (the “Project”), and their respective directors, officers, boards, trustees, employees, members, volunteers, agents, successors, and assigns (collectively, the “Released Parties”).
    This Release shall apply to each Not in Philly project or event in which I participate.</p>

    <p>I execute this Release in consideration of PRC providing me with the opportunity to participate as a volunteer in this Project.</p>

    <p>As a Project volunteer, I will be picking up trash and litter, without any supervision from PRC or any of the Released Parties, along a street or in another public area that I have selected.  I understand that the Project may include dangerous or hazardous activities.  I understand and acknowledge that the Project will take place in various environments, places and neighborhoods, such as streets or other roadways, recreation fields or centers, and parks, and involves proximity and exposure to and/or touching of trash, litter and other known or unknown substances, as to which it is impossible to foresee or predict specific risks or dangerous conditions and to have taken precautionary measures.  I understand that I am responsible for my behavior.  I agree to use my best judgment based upon my physical and mental abilities at all times, and to immediately terminate participation in this Project if activities become too strenuous, difficult or hazardous for me.</p>

    <p>By signing this Release, I knowingly assume and accept all risks in connection with my participation in the Project for any harm, injury, loss, or damage that I may suffer or sustain as a participant, whether such risks are foreseen or unforeseen, predictable or unpredictable, discussed or unstated, inherent or otherwise.</p>
    <p>I, for myself and for my family members, spouse, heirs, executors, administrators, successors, assigns, and anyone else acting on my behalf, hereby relinquish any and all rights to sue, and waive and release any and all claims for damages against the Released Parties for any and all types of economic loss or injury to person or property, including crippling or catastrophic injury or death, however, wherever, or whenever it may occur, as a result of my participation in the Project. This relinquishment of all rights to sue, and release and waiver of all claims for damages, applies regardless of whether the loss or injury to person or property was caused wholly or in part by negligence, defective or dangerous conditions of vehicles, personal or real property, trees, traffic controls and street lighting, streets and sidewalks and utility service facilities, strict product liability, breach of warranty or breach of contract, willful misconduct of any person, or any other theory of liability.</p>
    <p>PRC is committed to furthering discussion and growth of public service.  I hereby grant PRC full authorization and permission to use my name, voice, and/or photograph or image in any broadcast, telecast, advertising, promotion, blog, website posting, brochure, media publicity, and/or catalogue or other similar publication, or any other account of the Project in any media for any purposes whatsoever. I understand that any photographs or videotape or audiotape taken of me during my participation in the Project is the property of PRC and may be published and used in any media and/or manner to illustrate, promote, and advertise the Project.  This authorization and permission extends to any minor child of mine who may accompany me during my volunteer activities.</p>
    <p>I have read and fully understand this Release as set forth above.  I (or parent/legal guardian if volunteer is under age 18), have signed the Release under my own free will, and am suffering under no legal disabilities.  This Release constitutes the entire agreement and understanding between the parties hereto and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof.  I agree that if any portion of this Release is held invalid, then the remainder of this Release shall continue in full force and effect.</p>
